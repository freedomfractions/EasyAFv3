You are close, but are not quite lined up.  this is a more accurate description of what i expect.
For the project editor dll module that we are making, there are some major points that need to be understood for the UI and UX expectations.  This list is based on some items that we've learned over numerous other iterations to get this thing working.  
The interface should have the summary tab and the datatype tabs that are based on diffgrids.
The summary tab's metadata entry area needs to exactly match the fields, layouts, and presentation that is present in the stopgap's projectview interface.  That one isn't an MVVM implementation, but the UI/UX is great.  You will need to theme things and you will need to integrate the project editor we are developing in phase 4 deeply with our architecture in a similar fashion to the map editor.  
The project editor summary tab will also have drag and drop functionality with statistics, and will need the same file management UX you put into the map editor.  This will be more similar to the map editor than the stopgap layout.
The other tabs will be diffgrid based data tabs where users can view and lightly modify the actual data using the diffgrid control from EasyAFv2.  The diffgrid has a lot of built-in features, but we need to ensure they are exposed and utilized by the project editor to really work with our implementation.  the last implementation effort seemed to produce a reasonably solid custom control element, but it really struggled to integrate it cohesively into the solution.
When I say that we were running into issues with the diffgrid having a poor memory or suffering from issues with control reuse, I am specifically referring to the fact that when I moved from 1 tab to another, the diffgrid was effectively reloading.  I am fine if we reuse the same visual element for WPF, but the data context and the data being displayed needs to be preserved exactly in memory and not reloaded from scratch.  This was a major pain point in the last implementation, and I want to make sure we avoid it this time around.  An example issue was switching tabs and losing the cell selection and scroll position, which was very frustrating and difficult to work on, eventually leading to me scrapping that implementation altogether.
You should bring over the diffgrid before you try to start working with it and do a full review of its features and capabilities.  We need to ensure that we are leveraging it properly and not fighting against it.  If there are any limitations or issues with the diffgrid that prevent us from achieving the desired functionality, we need to modify the control before we get too far into the implementation.
There will be numerous ribbon controls needed for the project editor, so this will be a little more extensive than the map editor was.  We will wait until later to integrate this ribbon functionality, but it is important to keep in mind that it will be needed.
